> unflat is a European fintech platform that lets everyday users earn 4–7% APY on their savings — without needing any crypto knowledge. Deposits are converted to USDC and deployed into Morpho Protocol, an audited DeFi lending protocol. Based in Italy, unflat targets European savers looking for higher returns than traditional bank accounts.

## How It Works

- Users deposit EUR from their bank account
- Funds are converted to USDC, a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle
- USDC is lent to overcollateralized borrowers via Morpho Protocol
- Yield is generated from interest paid by borrowers
- Withdrawals are available anytime with no fees or lockups (1–2 business days back to bank)
- Every transaction is publicly recorded on-chain; users receive a public link to verify their deposits

## Key Features

- **No crypto knowledge required**: users interact with a simple EUR-in, EUR-out interface
- **Transparent**: all transactions are verifiable on-chain via a public link
- **No fees, no lockups**: withdraw anytime, no hidden charges
- **Powered by Morpho Protocol**: $2B+ in deposits, audited, no exploits in 2+ years of operation
- **USDC-based**: deposits are held in USDC, a regulated dollar-pegged stablecoin by Circle
- **Early access**: currently in waitlist phase with 500 initial spots
